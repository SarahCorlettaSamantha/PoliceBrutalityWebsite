        I'm one of the web developers of this website. My teammates and I picked police brutality for our website because its
        important to know the cause  and that how people are getting killed because of this. We hope you enjoy the information
        that we're giving you on this website and hopefully, you can help make a change with us. Thank you very much, Sincerely, Sarah Wilkerson

        <font size="5"> After the death of George Floyd the black community finally said that they had enough and now for the past two weeks we have been going through peaceful and not so peaceful protest like looting a lot of people want Justice for George Floyd and Brianna Taylor and all the victims that got killed because of police brutality and we want to change... So me and my teammate want to spread the word about how police brutality is wrong even though the police officers have to follow by the rules when arresting someone they do not have to go to a certain extent. For example like killing or beating up innocent... We hope that give you guys can help and make a change and lets makes this a better place. Sincerely, Sarah Corletta and Samantha.
